# checkpoint_management_disconnect_cloud_services

This resource allows you to execute Check Point Disconnect Cloud Services.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "checkpoint_management_disconnect_cloud_services" "example" {}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `force` - (Optional) Disconnect the Management Server from Check Point Infinity Portal, and reset the connection locally, regardless of the result in the Infinity Portal. This flag can be used if the disconnect-cloud-services command failed.

## How To Use
Make sure this command will be executed in the right execution order. 
note: terraform execution is not sequential.
